With this project, I had 4 goals
 * Learn mow about Blazor PWA's
 * Learn how to host a Blazor app on an Azure Static Web App
 * Use GitHub actions for CI/CD
 * Publish a PWA to the Android Store

This is a fun little project that let you roll dice. The dice sizes are the same dice used with many table-top RPG games, such as Dungeon and Dragons and Pathfinder. I am also using this dice app a kickstarter I backed, "2022 Quest Calendar An Adventure-a-Day RPG" and the 2021 version; see thier kickstarter here: http://kck.st/2Pn8g0t
