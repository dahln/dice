# Dice

## Production URL:

With this project, I had 4 goals
 * Learn more about Blazor PWA's
 * Publish a PWA to the Android Store
 * Learn how to host a Blazor app on an Azure Static Web App
 * Use GitHub actions for CI/CD

This is a fun little project that lets you roll dice. The dice sizes are the same dice used with many table-top RPG games, such as "Dungeon & Dragons" and "Pathfinder". I am also using this dice app with a kickstarter I backed, "2022 Quest Calendar An Adventure-a-Day RPG" and the 2021 version; find their kickstarter here: http://kck.st/2Pn8g0t
